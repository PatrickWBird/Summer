<h1>Games During the Summer Teir list</h1>
<div class="panel panel-default bg-success">
    <div class="panel-heading bg-primary" ><img src="Minecraft.jpg" alt="" style="width:25%; height: 25%;"></div>
    <div class="panel-body"><b>1.Minecraft</b>While I have played minecraft a lot, this games new update and playing a lot with my little brother was a really fun time! Easily my favorite game during the summer and only certified with how much fun I had with Matthew.</div>
</div>

<div class="panel panel-default bg-success">
    <div class="panel-heading bg-primary"><img src="images.jpg" alt="" style="width:25%; height: 25%;"></div>
    <div class="panel-body"><b>2.Skull</b>This was a game introduced to me at the start of the summer last year, in this class actually, and absolutely fell in love with it. I have still had a hard time getting past the two guard people in the mansion, but has still been a blast either way./div>
</div>

<div class="panel panel-default bg-success">
    <div class="panel-heading bg-primary"><img src="download.jpg" alt="" style="width:50%; height: 25%;"></div>
    <div class="panel-body"><b>3.Inscryption</b>I began playing this game with my little brother, Matthew, after I had an incredible time with the game. The only reason it isn't first is becuase I was able to play minecraft WITH Matthew instead of just watching him play.</div>
</div>

<div class="panel panel-default bg-success">
    <div class="panel-heading bg-primary"><img src="download (4).jfif" alt="" style="width:25%; height:25%;"></div>
    <div class="panel-body"><b>4.Pokemon Arceus</b>This was my favorite pokmeon game in ages and was a genuine breath of fresh air when it comes to pokmeon games in my opinion. The only reason it is this low is becuase I played it very little during the summer and other games I played more desurve the higher spots.</div>
</div>

<div class="panel panel-default bg-success">
    <div class="panel-heading bg-primary"><img src="download (3).jfif" alt="" style="width:25%; height: 25%;;"></div>
    <div class="panel-body"><b>5.Pokmeon Mystery Dungen</b>This game was pretty fun in my opinion, although it got way to repetive way too fast. Overall a good game but I wish there was a worthwile change to a mecanic or system after a while of playing.</div>
</div>

<div class="panel panel-default bg-success">
    <div class="panel-heading bg-primary"><img src="download (2).jfif" alt="" style="width:50%;" height="25%"></div>
    <div class="panel-body"><b>6.Pokemon Scarlet</b>While I did enjoy this game, it is horribly underdeveloped with no real improvments to major problems in pokmeon games as a whole and introduced a ton of new problems and gliches to boot.</div>
</div>

<div class="panel panel-default bg-success">
    <div class="panel-heading bg-primary"><img src="download (1).jfif" alt="" style="width:25%;" height="25%"></div>
    <div class="panel-body"><b>7.Clash Royale</b>I am so angry at this game and its developers as a whole, I love this game and have been playing it for years althoguh recently it has taken a dangerously pay to win path that has only continued to get worse and worse over the years. It finally hit the point where I droped the game as a whole and am most likely never going back.</div>
