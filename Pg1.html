            <div class="panel-body ">We set of on a mini roadtrip from Pheonix to San Deigo. Luckly, we were able to get a hotel a room early so we set of a day earlier than we were going too. While most of the six hour trip we did our own things, like I played Pokemon and listened to presaved shows. We had an especially fun family game of 10 guesses thoguh. After that We settled down for the night.</div>

Michael, my younger brother, spent the day at the beach with some friend. We spent an awesome day, shopping, having a nostalgic lunch, and enjoyed the familiar yet distinct scenery being insainly close to the ocean. That might we went to Joes Crab shack in honor of our grandma who saddly passed a month prior, although it was really fun and all of us really enjoyed ourselves.</div>

That was a supprisingly good deal and we made the most of it completly. Althoguh it was all fun and I had a great time on the rides and with the animals, my favorite was supprisingly the flamingo enclosure. I enjoyed the enclosure the most.</div>

Our fishing trip was fun but went horrible after I cought nothing, Michael caught one fish, and my dad caught two fish. Please also keep in mind that the trip was 6 hours long, also none of the fish we caught were even big enough to keep so we walked away empty handed. Although things get worse, Me and Michael had a bet on who could catch more so I also lost 5 dollars. Althoguh we had bad luck, The other two had incredible luck becuase they say blue whales, dolphins, and the like.</div>

            <div class="panel-body">Although I have already covered the meat of the trip, we still did some fun but less notable things with our time left in San Deigo. One fun thing we got to was feed koi fish, it was 25 cents for a handful of feed to feed an absolutely massive pont of lovely, lively fish along with speedy, theiving ducks. Another fun thing we did was going walking down the beach side and the peir area, a completly normal experience that was both had wonderful views of the sand, sky, and wildlife, along with the horrid view of garbage, people, and litter.</div>
