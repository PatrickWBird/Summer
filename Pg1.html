While most of the six hour trip we did our own things, like I played Pokemon and listened to presaved shows. We had an especially fun family game of 10 guesses thoguh. After that We settled down for the night.</div>

Michael, my younger brother, spent the day at the beach with some friend. We spent an awesome day, shopping, having a nostalgic lunch, and enjoyed the familiar yet distinct scenery being insainly close to the ocean. That might we went to Joes Crab shack in honor of our grandma who saddly passed a month prior, although it was really fun and all of us really enjoyed ourselves.</div>

That was a supprisingly good deal and we made the most of it completly. Althoguh it was all fun and I had a great time on the rides and with the animals, my favorite was supprisingly the flamingo enclosure. Yes, it is the picture on the first page and seeing them so active was truly incredible and I enjoyed the enclosure the most.</div>

That was truly shocking and now we are simply waiting to be reached out too.</div>
